# Third-Party Libraries

This folder contains third-party libraries of CORA. 
Be aware that the functionalities in this folder might not be as well tested as other files in CORA.

*Note to developers: Please think twice before adding a third-party toolbox to CORA. Do I really need this toolbox? Can I implement the required functionality myself? Maintaining dependencies and ensuring correctness becomes much harder with each added third-party library.*
