Note TL: 

`fourier` would also be available through the tbxmanager.
We provide it directly in cora for legacy reasons.
Thus, the mex file for windows and linux are included.

If another distribution is needed, 
one can just install it via the tbxmanager
and copy the respective mex file into this folder.

    tbxmanager install fourier

--------------------------
Original readme:

C code for fourier elimination in matlab

Type makewin for windows or makelinux for linux/unix at the matlab
command prompt.
