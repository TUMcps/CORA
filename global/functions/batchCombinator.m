function [CN, state] = batchCombinator(N, K, batch_size, state)
% batchCombinator - Function which generates a sampling without
%    repetitions/replacement of the set 1:N, taken K at a time.
%    Can be called batch-wise to enable large output.
%    Based on the combinator by Matt Fig.
%
% Syntax:
%    [CN, state] = batchCombinator(N, K, batch_size, state)
%
% Inputs:
%    N - sample set size
%    K - sample drawn at a time. Requirement: K<=M
%    batch_size - number of combinations to be returned
%    state - struct with combinator state
%
% Outputs:
%    CN - generated combinations
%    state - new combinator state
%
% Example: 
%    comb_state = struct;
%    while true
%       [new_batch, comb_state] = batchCombinator(30, 20, 1000, comb_state);
%       if comb_state.done == true
%           break;
%       end
%    end
