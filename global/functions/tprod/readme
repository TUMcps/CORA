This directory contains all the files needed install and run tprod. 

To install:
1) Put all these files in a directory where matlab can see them.
2) There is no step 2. ;-) 
   just go ahead and type: tprod() or tprod_testcases() to check it works. 
   (Actually the codes are written such that matlab will automatically make 
    the required mex files when you first use them -- provided you matlab is 
    set-up correctly this should be transparent to you).

To get help:
help tprod
from the matlab prompt

FILELIST

INSTALL           -- this file
mxInfo.c mxInfo.h -- utility functions for storing info about matrices 
tprod.c  tprod.h      -- generic (i.e. non-matlab specific) tprod code
tprod_mex.c       -- matlab wrapper code to use tprod.c
tprod.def         -- macro-code to auto-generate code for the different 
                     real/complex argument mixes for tprod calls.
tprod.m           -- M-file wrapper for the tprod help and for the mex-hiding 
                     routines.
tprod_testcases.m -- M-file to run a load of tprod unit-tests to verify 
                     correctness.
