  abstract = { Analog and mixed signal (AMS) designs are an important part of embedded
	systems that link digital designs to the analog world. Due to challenges
	associated with its verification process, AMS designs require a considerable
	portion of the total design cycle time. In contrast to digital designs,
	the verification of AMS systems is a challenging task that requires
	lots of expertise and deep understanding of their behavior. Researchers
	started lately studying the applicability of formal methods for the
	verification of AMS systems as a way to tackle the limitations of
	conventional verification methods like simulation. This paper surveys
	research activities in the formal verification of AMS designs as
	well as compares the different proposed approaches.},
