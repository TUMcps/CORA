	abstract = {This paper describes the architecture and implementation of an autonomous passenger vehicle designed to navigate using locally perceived information in preference to potentially inaccurate or incomplete map data. The vehicle architecture was designed to handle the original DARPA Urban Challenge requirements of perceiving and navigating a road network with segments defined by sparse waypoints. The vehicle implementation includes many heterogeneous sensors with significant communications and computation bandwidth to capture and process high-resolution, high-rate sensor data. The output of the comprehensive environmental sensing subsystem is fed into a kino-dynamic motion planning algorithm to generate all vehicle motion. The requirements of driving in lanes, three-point turns, parking, and maneuvering through obstacle fields are all generated with a unified planner. A key aspect of the planner is its use of closed-loop simulation in a Rapidly-exploring Randomized Trees (RRT) algorithm, which can randomly explore the space while efficiently generating smooth trajectories in a dynamic and uncertain environment. The overall system was realized through the creation of a powerful new suite of software tools for message-passing, logging, and visualization. These innovations provide a strong platform for future research in autonomous driving in GPS-denied and highly dynamic environments with poor a priori information.},

	abstract = {Analog and mixed signal (AMS) designs are an important part of embedded systems that link digital designs to the analog world. Due to challenges associated with its verification process, AMS designs require a considerable portion of the total design cycle time. In contrast to digital designs, the verification of AMS systems is a challenging task that requires lots of expertise and deep understanding of their behavior. Researchers started lately studying the applicability of formal methods for the verification of AMS systems as a way to tackle the limitations of conventional verification methods like simulation. This paper surveys research activities in the formal verification of AMS designs as well as compares the different proposed approaches.},

@article{Geng2018,
	abstract = {Immersive and non-immersive simulations have been widely adopted to improve product maintainability design based on virtual maintenance technique. On the one hand, immersive simulation shows that our body actions, especially those of the hand, are suitable for detailed operation simulation. Meanwhile, the problem associated with immersive simulation is hardware capacity as constrained by the environment. On the other hand, non-immersive simulation shows superiority in large-scale movement; however, problems, such as cumbersome operation, time-consuming labor, and inadequate precision, arise in terms of complicated and repeated operations. Considering the preceding advantages and limitations mentioned, this study presents a virtual simulation method by purposefully integrating human motion data from immersive and non-immersive simulations. We first decompose maintenance process based on common operations to determine typical types of maintenance motions. We then analyze the classified motion characters to identify a suitable simulation approach for each type of motion. Subsequently, motion data from immersive and non-immersive simulation are processed by spatial and temporary alignment. These data are further integrated by synchronous or asynchronous cooperative control for their respective simulation requirement. Lastly, we adopt interpolation to further process position and posture angle data and achieve smooth transition between adjacent simulation slices. Three cases are introduced to separately verify the feasibility of synchronous and asynchronous control and smooth transition in the method.},

@article{Schwarting2018,
	abstract = {In this review, we provide an overview of emerging trends and challenges in the field of intelligent and autonomous, or self-driving, vehicles. Recent advances in the field of perception, planning, and decision-making for autonomous vehicles have led to great improvements in functional capabilities, with several prototypes already driving on our roads and streets. Yet challenges remain regarding guaranteed performance and safety under all driving circumstances. For instance, planning methods that provide safe and system-compliant performance in complex, cluttered environments while modeling the uncertain interaction with other traffic participants are required. Furthermore, new paradigms, such as interactive planning and end-to-end learning, open up questions regarding safety and reliability that need to be addressed. In this survey, we emphasize recent approaches for integrated perception and planning and for behavior-aware planning, many of which rely on machine learning. This raises the question of verification and safety, which we also touch upon. Finally, we discuss the state of the art and remaining challenges for managing fleets of autonomous vehicles.},

@inproceedings{Khedr2021,
	abstract = {Neural Networks (NNs) have increasingly apparent safety implications commensurate with their proliferation in real-world applications: both unanticipated as well as adversarial misclassifications can result in fatal outcomes. As a consequence, techniques of formal verification have been recognized as crucial to the design and deployment of safe NNs. In this paper, we introduce a new approach to formally verify the most commonly considered safety specifications for ReLU NNs – i.e. polytopic specifications on the input and output of the network. Like some other approaches, ours uses a relaxed convex program to mitigate the combinatorial complexity of the problem. However, unique in our approach is the way we use a convex solver not only as a linear feasibility checker, but also as a means of penalizing the amount of relaxation allowed in solutions. In particular, we encode each ReLU by means of the usual linear constraints, and combine this with a convex objective function that penalizes the discrepancy between the output of each neuron and its relaxation. This convex function is further structured to force the largest relaxations to appear closest to the input layer; this provides the further benefit that the most “problematic” neurons are conditioned as early as possible, when conditioning layer by layer. This paradigm can be leveraged to create a verification algorithm that is not only faster in general than competing approaches, but is also able to verify considerably more safety properties; we evaluated PEREGRiNN on a standard MNIST robustness verification suite to substantiate these claims.},
