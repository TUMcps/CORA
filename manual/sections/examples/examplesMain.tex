\section{Examples} \label{sec:examples}
\logToConsole{EXAMPLES}

This section presents a variety of examples that have been published in different papers. For each example, we provide a reference to the paper so that the details of the system can be studied there. The focus of this manual is on how the examples in the papers can be realized using CORA---this, of course, is not shown in scientific papers due to space restrictions.
