\subsection{CORA@ARCH} \label{sec:ARCH}

The ARCH\footnote{\underline{A}pplied Ve\underline{r}ification for \underline{C}ontinuous and \underline{H}ybrid Systems} friendly competition is the main platform for comparing the results of different reachability tools on multiple challenging benchmark problems. CORA has participated in the ARCH friendly competitions since the first competition in 2017. Results of the competition can be found in the yearly ARCH proceedings \cite{Frehse2017,Frehse2018,Frehse2019}. In particular, CORA has participated in the linear systems category \cite{Althoff2017b,Althoff2018c,Althoff2019b,Althoff2020a} and the nonlinear systems category \cite{Chen2017,Immler2018,Immler2019,Geretti2020}; CORA/SX has participated in the same categories in 2018 \cite{Althoff2018c,Immler2018} and in the linear systems category in 2019 \cite{Althoff2019b}.

All results from all tools participating in the friendly competitions can be re-computed using the ARCH repeatability packages, which are publicly available:

The results from the last ARCH competition can be found in the CORA toolbox at \textit{examples/ARCHcompetition/}. We also published the results as Code Ocean capsules\footnote{see \url{https://codeocean.com/capsule/2113947/tree} and \url{https://codeocean.com/capsule/1267711/tree}}, which allows everyone to conveniently reproduce the results online without the need to install anything.
