\subsection{Neural Networks as Controllers}
\label{sec:neuralNetworkClosedLoop}

CORA also allows the verification of dynamic systems where neural networks are used to control the system dynamics.
Please visit \cref{sec:neuralNetContrSys} for more information.

Examples can be found at \texttt{./cora/examples/contDynamics/neurNetContrSys}.
