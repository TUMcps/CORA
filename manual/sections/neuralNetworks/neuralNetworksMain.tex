\section{Neural Networks} \label{sec:neuralNetworks}
\logToConsole{NEURAL NETWORKS}

In this section, we describe the capabilities of CORA to formally verify existing neural networks.
Additionally, one can train robust neural networks in CORA by integrating formal methods into the training process.
Please also install the required toolboxes described in \cref{sec:installation} when using neural networks in CORA.
