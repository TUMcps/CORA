\subsubsubsection{Fullspace} \label{sec:fullspace}

The fullspace contains all elements.
This set representation $\mathcal{FS} = \mathbb{R}^n$ is defined as follows:
\begin{equation}
	\mathcal{FS} = \R^{n}.
	\label{eq:defFullspace}
\end{equation}
Fullspaces are represented in CORA by the class \texttt{fullSpace}.
An object of class \texttt{fullSpace} can be constructed as follows:
\begin{equation*}
	\begin{split}
		\mathcal{FS} = \texttt{fullSpace}(n), \\
	\end{split}
\end{equation*}
where $n$ is the number of dimensions of the set.
Fullspaces are used in hybrid systems to model unbounded invariant sets.
