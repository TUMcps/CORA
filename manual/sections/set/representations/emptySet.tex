\subsubsubsection{Empty Set} \label{sec:emptySet}

A empty set does not contain any elements.
This set representation $\mathcal{O} \subset \mathbb{R}^n$ is defined as follows:
\begin{equation}
	\mathcal{O} = \emptyset.
	\label{eq:defEmptySet}
\end{equation}
Empty sets are represented in CORA by the class \texttt{emptySet}.
An object of class \texttt{emptySet} can be constructed as follows:
\begin{equation*}
	\begin{split}
		\mathcal{O} = \texttt{emptySet}(n), \\
	\end{split}
\end{equation*}
where $n$ is the number of dimensions of the set.
Empty sets are used in hybrid systems to model instant transitions.
