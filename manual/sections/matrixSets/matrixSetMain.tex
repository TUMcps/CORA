\logToConsole{MATRIX SET REPRESENTATIONS AND OPERATIONS}

Besides vector sets as introduced in the previous section, it is often useful to represent sets of possible matrices. This occurs for instance when a linear system has uncertain parameters as described later in \cref{sec:linearParamSystems}. CORA supports the following matrix set representations:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Matrix polytope (\cref{sec:polytopeMatrix}).
    \item Matrix zonotope (\cref{sec:zonotopeMatrix}, specialization of a matrix polytope).
    \item Interval matrix (\cref{sec:intervalMatrix}, specialization of a matrix zonotope).
\end{itemize}
Note that we use the term \textit{matrix polytope} instead of \textit{polytope matrix}. The reason is that the analogous term \textit{vector polytope} makes sense, while \textit{polytope vector} can be misinterpreted as a vertex of a polytope. We do not use the term \textit{matrix interval} since the term \textit{interval matrix} is already established.

For each matrix set representation, the conversion to all other matrix set computations is implemented. Of course, conversions to specializations are realized in an over-approximative way, while the other direction is computed exactly (see \cref{tab:matSetConversion}). In order to convert a matrix set, it is sufficient to pass the current matrix set object to the class constructor of the target matrix set representation, as demonstrated by the following example:

    \label{tab:matSetConversion}
    \begin{tabular}{ l c c c}
        \toprule
        & \textbf{matPolytope} & \textbf{matZonotope} & \textbf{intervalMatrix} \\
        \midrule
        \textbf{matPolytope} (\cref{sec:polytopeMatrix})    & -                    & o                    & o                       \\
        \textbf{matZonotope} (\cref{sec:zonotopeMatrix})    & e                    & -                    & o                       \\
        \textbf{intervalMatrix} (\cref{sec:intervalMatrix}) & e                    & e                    & -                       \\
        \bottomrule
    \end{tabular}
\end{table}

We first introduce importrant operations for matrix sets in \cref{sec:matSetOperations} before we describe the matrix set representations implemented in detail in \cref{sec:matSetRepresentations}.
