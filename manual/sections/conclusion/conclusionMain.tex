CORA is a toolbox for the implementation of prototype reachability analysis algorithms in MATLAB. The software is modular and is organized into four main categories: vector set representations, matrix set representations, continuous dynamics, and hybrid dynamics. CORA includes novel algorithms for reachability analysis of nonlinear systems and hybrid systems with a special focus on scalability; for instance, a power network with more than $50$ continuous state variables has been verified in \cite{Althoff2014c}. The efficiency of the algorithms used means it is even possible to verify problems online, i.e., while they are in operation \cite{Althoff2014b}.

One particularly useful feature of CORA is its adaptability: the algorithms can be tailored to the reachability analysis problem in question. Forthcoming integration into SpaceEx, which has a user interface and a model editor, should go some way towards making CORA more accessible to non-experts.
