            The philosophy, architecture, and capabilities of the \underline{Co}ntinuous \underline{R}eachability \underline{A}nalyzer (CORA) are presented.
            CORA is a toolbox that integrates various vector and matrix set representations and operations on these set representations as well as reachability algorithms of various dynamic system classes.
            The software is designed such that set representations can be exchanged without having to modify the code for reachability analysis.
            CORA has a modular design, making it possible to use the capabilities of the various set representations for other purposes besides reachability analysis.
            The toolbox is designed using the object-oriented paradigm, such that users can safely use methods without concerning themselves with detailed information hidden inside the object.
            Since the toolbox is written in MATLAB, the installation and use is platform independent.
            CORA is released under \href{http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.txt}{GPLv3}.
