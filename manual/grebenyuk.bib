abstract = {Branch and bound algorithms are methods for global optimization in nonconvex prob-lems [LW66, Moo91]. They are nonheuristic, in the sense that they maintain a provable upper and lower bound on the (globally) optimal objective value; they terminate with a certificate proving that the suboptimal point found is ǫ-suboptimal. Branch and bound al-gorithms can be (and often are) slow, however. In the worst case they require effort that grows exponentially with problem size, but in some cases we are lucky, and the methods converge with much less effort. In these notes we describe two typical and simple examples of branch and bound methods, and show some typical results, for a minimum cardinality problem. 1 Unconstrained nonconvex minimization The material in this section is taken from [BBB91]. The branch and bound algorithm we describe here finds the global minimum of a function f : R m → R over an m-dimensional rectangle Q init , to within some prescribed accuracy ǫ. We let f ⋆ denote the optimal value, i.e., f ⋆ = inf x∈Q init f (x). For a rectangle Q ⊆ Q init we define $\Phi$ min (Q) = inf},

abstract = {Being able to soundly estimate roundoff errors in floating-point computations is important for many applications in embedded systems and scientific computing. Due to the unintuitive nature of floating-point arithmetic, automated static analysis tools are highly valuable for this task. The results, however, are only as correct as the implementations of the static analysis tools. This paper presents a new modular framework for the analysis of finite-precision computations which computes sound roundoff error bounds fully automatically. The main focus of this paper are the correctness certificates generated by our framework. These can be checked independently by our checker functions, thus providing more confidence in the analysis results. We present implementations of certificate generation and checking for both Coq and HOL4 and evaluate it on a number of examples from the literature. The experiments use both in-logic evaluation of Coq and HOL4, and execution of extracted code outside of the logics: we benchmark Coq extracted unverified OCaml code and a CakeML-generated verified binary.},

abstract = {State-of-the-art static analysis tools for verifying finite-precision code compute worst-case absolute error bounds on numerical errors. These are, however, often not a good estimate of accuracy as they do not take into account the magnitude of the computed values. Relative errors, which compute errors relative to the value's magnitude, are thus preferable. While today's tools do report relative error bounds, these are merely computed via absolute errors and thus not necessarily tight or more informative. Furthermore, whenever the computed value is close to zero on part of the domain, the tools do not report any relative error estimate at all. Surprisingly, the quality of relative error bounds computed by today's tools has not been systematically studied or reported to date. In this paper, we investigate how state-of-the-art static techniques for computing sound absolute error bounds can be used, extended and combined for the computation of relative errors. Our experiments on a standard benchmark set show that computing relative errors directly, as opposed to via absolute errors, is often beneficial and can provide error estimates up to six orders of magnitude tighter, i.e. more accurate. We also show that interval subdivision, another commonly used technique to reduce over-approximations, has less benefit when computing relative errors directly, but it can help to alleviate the effects of the inherent issue of relative error estimates close to zero.},

abstract = {An overview of the background of Taylor series methods and the utilization of the differential algebraic structure is given, and various associated techniques are reviewed. The conventional Taylor methods are extended to allow for a rigorous treatment of bounds for the remainder of the expansion in a similarly universal way. Utilizing differential algebraic and functional analytic arguments on the set of Taylor models, arbitrary order integrators with rigorous remainder treatment are developed. The integrators can meet pre-specified accuracy requirements in a mathematically strict way, and are a stepping stone towards fully rigorous estimates of stability of repetitive systems.},

@article{Althoff2017,
abstract = {Interval arithmetic can be seen as one of the workhorses for formal verification ap-proaches. The popularity of interval arithmetic stems from the fact that the possible outcomes of almost all frequently occurring mathematical expressions can be bounded. A disadvantage of interval arithmetic is that due to the negligence of dependencies of vari-ables in expressions, results can be overly conservative. For this reason, interval arithmetic is typically used in formal verification tools when formulas are not contributing much to the accuracy of the overall approach, but do not belong to a restrictive class of expressions and are thus hard to evaluate. Although a lot of textbooks and software manuals for interval arithmetic exist, we have not found a complete and detailed description of how all standard mathematical functions are evaluated. This work changes this situation and describes concisely the evaluation of all standard mathematical functions. The described techniques are implemented as a class in CORA, a free MATLAB tool for continuous reachability analysis. Previously, CORA used the MATLAB toolbox INTLAB, but this tool is no longer freely available. Thus, our interval arithmetic class is currently the only freely available implementation of interval arithmetic that runs under current MATLAB versions. We have thoroughly tested our implementation against INTLAB and present the results.},

abstract = {Interval methods for verified integration of initial value problems (IVPs) for ODEs have been used for more than 40 years. For many classes of IVPs, these methods are able to compute guaranteed error bounds for the flow of an ODE, where traditional methods provide only approximations to a solution. Overestimation, however, is a potential drawback of verified methods. For some problems, the computed error bounds become overly pessimistic, or the integration even breaks down. The dependency problem and the wrapping effect are particular sources of overestimations in interval computations. Berz and his coworkers have developed Taylor model methods, which extend interval arithmetic with symbolic computations. The latter is an effective tool for reducing both the dependency problem and the wrapping effect. By construction, Taylor model methods appear particularly suitable for integrating nonlinear ODEs. We analyze Taylor model based integration of ODEs and compare Taylor model methods with traditional enclosur...},
