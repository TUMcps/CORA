- Paper: `<paper-title>`‚ùó
- Venue: `<venue-name>`‚ùó

  - `./settings.sh`         : settings for scripts
  - `./screen.sh`           : script to run `run.sh` [within a linux screen](#run-from-command-line-recommended)

## Step 1: Installation
This folder contains the code as well as a docker file to run the code in one click (see below).

However, you need to provide a Matlab license.
You can specify i) a [license server](#option-1-license-server-recommended), ii) a [license file](#option-2-license-file), or iii) [run it directly in Matlab](#option-3-install-matlab-and-required-toolboxes-not-recommended):

### Option 1: License server (recommended)

- Ask your Matlab administrator if a Matlab license server is available.
- In `settings.sh`, configure the license server : `LICENSE_SERVER=<port>@<hostname>`. 
- Proceed with [Step 2: üîµ Run from command line](#-run-from-command-line-recommended)

### Option 2: License file
Download a license file `license.lic` to run the code:
- Create a Matlab license file: 
	For the docker container to run Matlab, one has to create a new license file for the container.
	Log in with your Matlab account at https://www.mathworks.com/licensecenter/licenses/.
	Click on your license, and then navigate to
	1. "Install and Activate"
    1. "View activated computers"
	1. "Activate a Computer"
	(...may differ depending on how your licensing is set up).
- Choose:
	- Release: `R2024b`‚ùó
	- Operating System: `Linux`
	- Host ID: `0242AC11000a` (= Default MAC of docker container)
	- Computer Login Name: `matlab`
	- Activation Label: `<any name>`
- When prompted if the software is already installed, choose "Yes".
- Download the file and place it next to `Dockerfile`.
- Proceed with [Step 2: üîµ Run from command line](#-run-from-command-line-recommended).

### Option 3: Install Matlab and required toolboxes (not recommended)

Install Matlab on your system and install all required toolboxes for CORA (see Sec. 1.3 in [CORA manual](https://cora.in.tum.de/manual)). The CORA repository is already included in `./code/cora`, so you don't have to clone it.

Proceed with [Step 2: üü† Run from Matlab](#-run-from-matlab).

## Step 2: Run the code

### üîµ Run from command line (recommended)

You can run the evaluation in one click in a docker container using the `run.sh` script (see [bug fix: windows/linux line breaks](#known-error-messages) below):

	./run.sh <evalname> <gpu-device>
	
where the argument `<evalname>` is used to name the evaluation run (defaults to datetime),
and the optional argument `<gpu-device>` is used to select the GPU (see [GPU settings](#gpu-settings) below).

The results will be stored to `./results/<evalname>` after the evaluation finishes.
To view intermediate results during the evaluation, you can copy the current `results` folder out of the docker container using

    docker cp "$DOCKER_NAME":/results .

where `DOCKER_NAME` is as in `settings.sh` or using `docker ps`.

If you are using [linux screens](https://www.howtogeek.com/662422/how-to-use-linuxs-screen-command/),
you can also call

    ./screen.sh <evalname> <gpu-device>

which might be helpful when running the script on a server to ensure it finishes correctly even if your connection is interrupted.
You can always detach from the screen using `CTRL+A+D` and reattach using 

    screen -rd $SCREEN_NAME

where `SCREEN_NAME` is as in `settings.sh` or using `screen -ls`.

#### Variables

To set the variables `DOCKER_NAME` and `SCREEN_NAME` automatically, you can call

    source settings.sh <evalname>

which makes the variables available in the current terminal instance,
where `<evalname>` is again the name of the evaluation.


#### GPU Settings

For docker to use the GPU, you have to specify the `<gpu-device>` docker should use.
You can find your available GPUs using the command `nvidia-smi`.
Possible options are the GPU id (e.g., `0`), `all`, and `none` (default).
Read more about it here: https://docs.docker.com/desktop/features/gpu/.

Please note that this setting might not be necessary for this repeatability package.

### üü† Run from Matlab

Alternatively, open this directory in Matlab and run:

	addpath(genpath('./code')); 
    main('<evalname>');

where the optional argument `<evalname>` is used to name the evaluation run (defaults to datetime).
The results will be stored to `./results/<evalname>`.
	
**Note:** Please ensure that all required toolboxes for CORA are installed (see [Step 1: Option 3](#option-3-install-matlab-and-required-toolboxes-not-recommended) above).

### Important Notes

- *add any information here, e.g., settings to reduce evaluation time.* ‚ùó
- When running the evaluation in docker, docker might randomly stop if not enough memory is available.

### Known error messages

If running `run.sh`/`screen.sh` results in obscure error messages (`$'\r': command not found`), 
it might be due to different line breaks in `run.sh`/`screen.sh` using windows/linux. 
You can fix it using:

    sed -i 's/\r$//' *.sh
