% parseInitial - Constructs CORA sets from initial values given in a
%    SpaceEx-ConfigFile
%
% Syntax:  
%    [initialSet,inputSet] = parseInitial(configLine,fileDesc)
%
% Inputs:
%    configLine  - Line (String) from the config-file containig the initial
%                  values
%    fileDesc    - File descriptor for the config-file, in case the initial
%                  values are longer than a single line
%    state_names - Struct array containing structs with field "name"
%                  specifying the names of the state variables
%                  NOTE: Names must be in order!
%    input_names - Struct array containing structs with field "name"
%                  specifying the names of the input variables
%                  NOTE: Names must be in order!
%
% Outputs:
%    initialSet - CORA interval object denoting the initial sets of all
%                 state variables as mentioned and in the same order as 
%                 given in state_names
%    inputSet   - CORA interval object denoting the initial sets of all
%                 input variables as mentioned and in the same order as 
%                 given in input_names
