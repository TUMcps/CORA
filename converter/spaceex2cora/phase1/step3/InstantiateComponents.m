function instances = InstantiateComponents(templates,rootIdx)
% InstantiateComponents - builds a tree of component instances, beginning
%    with a root component. Instances are created, by applying variable
%    mappings on their templates. Instantiate through deeper trees with
%    breadth-first search, by keeping track of all still open branches.
%
% Syntax:  
%    instances = InstantiateComponents(templates,rootIdx)
%
% Inputs:
%    templates - struct containing all base/network components and their
%                properties (variable names, binds, flow equations,
%                invariants, guard sets, reset function, synchronization
%                labels, etc.), as processed from SpaceEx xml-file in the
%                function parseTemplates
%    rootIdx - ID of the root component (default: top-most network component)
%
% Outputs:
%    instances - instantiated components
