# Continuous Sets

The ```contSet``` class acts as super class for all continuous set representations.

All common functionalities are implemented here, as well as fallback functions in case a specific operation is not yet implemented for a set representation.
Note that some functions have a variant with an underscore appended to the function name.
The underscore variants are used internally for efficiency, bypassing e.g. parameter checks.
