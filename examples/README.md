# Examples

This folder contains all examples of CORA.
The examples are structured analogously to the respective classes of CORA.
Additionally, all examples from the website can be found in the `./website` folder.

Check the respective subfolders and Section 9 in the <a target='_blank' href="https://tumcps.github.io/CORA/manual">CORA manual</a> for more information.

Note: Smaller examples have the prefix `example_`, while examples with the prefix `benchmark_` can take a very long time.
